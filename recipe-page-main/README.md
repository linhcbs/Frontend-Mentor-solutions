## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3

### What I learned

- Learned how to manipulate the styles of `<ul>, <ol>, and <li>` elements.
- Having overly long class names and too many classes is not always ideal.
- It's better to group components into classes based on both their content and **styles** for easier styling in the future.
