## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3

### What I learned

- The CSS `box-shadow` property (seriously, this time).
- Using `Flexbox` is better than manually setting `margin-bottom` for each component in the card.
- Making components responsive can be simpler without explicitly using `@media screen`.
